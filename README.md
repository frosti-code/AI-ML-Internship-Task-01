 ðŸŒ¸ Task 001: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

 ðŸ“Œ Objective
Load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions, relationships, and detect outliers.

---

 ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset (CSV format)  

---
 ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas.
2. Inspected:
   - Shape
   - Column names
   - First few rows
   - Summary statistics (`.info()` and `.describe()`).
3. Created visualizations:
   - Scatter plot: Petal length vs Petal width.
   - Histograms for feature distributions.
   - Boxplots to identify outliers.
4. Derived key insights from the visual analysis.

ðŸ¤– Models Applied
_No machine learning model applied â€” this was purely exploratory data analysis._

 ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Setosa species has significantly smaller petals compared to Versicolor and Virginica.
- Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly, but Virginica generally has larger petals.
- Histograms show features are not perfectly normally distributed.
- Outliers are visible in petal width for Virginica.
